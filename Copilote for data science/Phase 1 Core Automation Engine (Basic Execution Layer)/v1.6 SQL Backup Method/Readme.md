# Core Operations:
Data Display: Ability to show data based on natural language requests
Data Visualization: Create visualizations from data using natural language commands
Data Modification: Capability to modify datasets in real-time

# Architecture Components:
Natural Language Processing (NL_processor.py): Interprets user requests and determines the operation type
SQL Operations (SQL_Operations.py): Handles database operations and backups
Modular Engine Design:
Engine_Display_data.py: Handles data display operations
Engine_Visualize_data.py: Manages data visualization tasks
Engine_Modify_data.py: Controls data modification operations

# Key Improvements in v1.6:
SQL Backup Method implementation
Modular architecture with separate engines for different operations
Groq-based input processing for each operation type
Interactive command-line interface

# User Interface:
Command-line interface with natural language input support
Continuous operation mode with exit option
Clear operation feedback and status messages

# Data Management:
SQL-based data storage and retrieval
Backup functionality for data safety
Real-time data modification capabilities


This version represents a significant evolution from previous versions, particularly with the addition of SQL backup methods and a more modular architecture. The system is designed to handle three main types of operations (display, visualize, modify) through natural language commands, making it more accessible for data science tasks.
